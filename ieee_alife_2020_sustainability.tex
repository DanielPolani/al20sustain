\begin{abstract}
Systems of coupled elements, with dynamics governed by cubic
differential equations, have been established as simple and powerful
models to study sustainability. Here we combine such systems with an
agent which impacts upon the system. This enables characterising
sustainability as empowerment, a property emerging from the
interaction between the agent and the ecological systems sustaining
it. We present initial results illustrating the effects of dynamical
properties of the system affect on empowerment, and thereby
potentially on sustainability.

\section{Introduction}

Sustainability is widely recognised as a central concept that should
underpin decisions and policies, aiming to ensure continued survival,
welfare and prosperity of humankind. In some contrast to its perceived
importance, a rigorous and generally applicable definition of
sustainability continues to prove elusive. Some approaches to define
sustainability, such as the Brundtland definition
\cite{Brundlandcommission1987}, are frequently invoked in the context
of considering Earth as it is, but have not been formalised to enable
their application to other systems, such as Artificial Life models.

% \cite{Brundlandcommission1987} has described
% sustainable development as ``development that meets the needs and
% aspirations of the present without compromising the ability to meet
% those in the future'', and since the last two decades, the concept of

Ecosystem stability is a prerequisite for sustainability in the sense
that it is necessary to provide resources or ecosystem services on a
permanent basis. An individual resource can be considered to be used
sustainably if it is regenerated at a rate that (at least) matches the
rate at which it is exploited. This idea underpins methods for
measuring footprints \cite{Wackernagel2019_defyingthefootprintoracle},
which can be aggregated over a key set of resources to calculate e.g.\
Earth Overshoot
Day\footnote{https://www.footprintnetwork.org/2020/06/05/press-release-june-2020-earth-overshoot-day/}.

A considerable proportion of sustainability work focuses on
conservation of natural systems by reducing footprints of
exploitation, pollution and degradation, e.g.\ the Planetary
Boundaries
framework\footnote{https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/planetary-boundaries/planetary-boundaries/about-the-research/the-nine-planetary-boundaries.html}
implicitly assumes that there are fixed boundaries of (regenerative)
capacity, and that resource consumption or depletion needs to be
reduced where these boundaries are exceeded. However, for some
resources, boundaries of production or regeneration rates can be
greatly expanded. The most dramatic example of this is arguably
roduction of staple foods, which has increased by orders of magnitude
by a succession of technology developments, starting with the
emergence of agriculture and more recently including fertilisers and
plant breeding, culminating in the Green Revolution.

% introduce tipping systems

% discuss problems of "unwanted" / "unsustainable" stable fixed points

% More formal approaches to sustainability often focus on stability.
% While stability of the sustaining environment (e.g.\ the planet with
% its ecological and abiotic systems) is necessary for
% sustainability, focusing on it alone excludes the active role of the
% entity seeking to be sustained (e.g.\ humankind).


We have previously adapted \emph{empowerment}, an
information-theoretic quantity measuring the future potentialities
that an agent can invoke to characterise sustainability for an agent
inside a given environment \cite{Kim2009_sustainability}. In that
work, empowerment was constrained to only include potentialities when
their effect could be reversed, as a measure for active reversibility
of the agent's environmental exploits. We now modify this idea. We
adapt the concept of tipping elements, introduced in
\cite{Lenton2008_tippingelements}. These are models for ``tipping''
dynamics where a desired locally stable state can be perturbed strongly
enough to move into an undesired stable state.  Bi-stable differential
equations have been used to formally model tipping elements, and these
have been used as building blocks to model and study complex systems
comprised of multiple interacting tipping elements
\cite{Brummitt2015_coupledcatastrophes,Klose2019_interactingtippingelements}.
We show how to combine the empowerment with the tipping element
formalism to offer a framework to model how well an agent can drive a
system ``gone bad'' into its desired state.

% sustainability, but so far the agent to be sustained has not been
% expressly included in such approaches.

% identical to interaction matrix in cubic system --> distribution of

% cubic interaction terms are global.

\section{System}

Our system consists of $n$ coupled elements, each of which has a state
$x_i \in \mathbb{R}$ which may be thought of as the abundance of e.g.\
a species or a resource. The state of the entire system is thus a
vector $\vectorsym{x} = (x_1, \ldots, x_n)^T \in \mathbb{R}^n$. The
temporal evolution of the system are determined by the intrinsic
dynamics of the environment, and the impact of an agent. Formally, the
dynamics of each tipping element are determined by the differential
equation
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq_coupledwithagent}
  \frac{dx_i}{dt} = x_i - x_i^3 + c_i + C_i(\vectorsym{x}) + \agentimpact_i(t)
\end{equation}
where where $c_i$ is a random value that is drawn from a uniform
distribution centred on $0$ and constant for a given system,
$C(\vectorsym{x})$ is a coupling function, and $\agentimpact_i(t)$ is
represents the agent impact which may be interpreted as the rate at
which a resource (e.g.\ biomass) is exploited or a substance (e.g.\
plastic, phosphates or other chemicals) is released into the
environment. The coupling function is given by
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq_couplingfunction}
  C_i(\vectorsym{x}) = \sum_j d_{ji} x_j
\end{equation}
where the coupling parameters $d_{ji}$ are drawn from a uniform
$0$-centred distribution for $j < i$ and set to $0$ otherwise, i.e.\
$(d_{ij})$ is a lower triangular matrix.

The design of the environment comprised of tipping elements governed
by cubic differential equations falls into the general class of models
reviewed by Klose \textit{et al.}\
\cite{Klose2019_interactingtippingelements}.

Restricting the interaction matrix $d_{ji}$ to a lower triangular
matrix results in the interactions between the element forming a
directed acyclic graph (DAG). In other words, the interactions form a
hierarchy in the sense that each element affects only those with an
index greater than its own. We chose this design because cyclic
interactions qualitatively change the ``tipping point''
characteristics of the elements, as discussed in more detail below.

% todo: make sure loss of tipping point characteristics (cyclic
% attractors rather than fixed points etc) is discussed below.

% \begin{equation}
%   \label{eq_cubic}
%   \frac{dx}{dt} = ax - bx^3 + c
% \end{equation}
% As \cite{Klose2019_interactingtippingelements}, we restrict
% ourselves to $a = 1$ and $b = 1$.

% The state of a system of $n$ interacting tipping elements is a vector
% $\vectorsym{x} = [x_1, \ldots, x_n]^T$ whose interaction is modelled
% by a diff

%  a coupling function $C_i(\vectorsym{x})$
% \begin{equation}
%   \label{eq_coupled}
%   \frac{dx_i}{dt} = ax_i - bx_i^3 + c_i + C_i(\vectorsym{x})\;.
% \end{equation}
% Following \cite{Klose2019_interactingtippingelements}, we use coupling
% functions
% \begin{equation}
%   \label{eq_couplingfunction}
%   C_i(\vectorsym{x}) = \sum_j d_{ji} x_j
% \end{equation}
% but unlike their work, we require $d_{ji} = 0$ if $j \ge i$,
% i.e.\ $(d_{ij})$ to be a lower triangular matrix. This restriction
% ensures that, for coupled tipping elements, their bi-stable character
% is preserved (bi-directional interactions between tipping elements can
% result in global dynamical features that amount to a qualitative
% departure from the ``tipping point'' system characteristics, such as
% cyclic attractors). Thus the graph of interactions becomes a directed
% acyclic graph, in which we can arrange the components in order, so
% that the steady state of component $x_i$ depends only on higher-ranked
% components $x_1, \ldots x_{i-1}$, enabling efficient computation of
% fixed points of the system. This models an interrelated, but
% hierarchical ``ecosystem'' with different levels of importance for the
% subsystems.  Model now the additional effect of the agent
% (``humanity'') on its environment by the totality of the terms
% $\agentimpact_i(t)$:
% \begin{equation}
%   \label{eq_coupledwithagent}
%   \frac{dx_i}{dt} = ax_i - bx_i^3 + c_i + C_i(\vectorsym{x}) + \agentimpact_i(t)
% \end{equation}
% This affects the rate of change in the $x_i$; examples would be modelling
% emissions of carbon dioxide, release of nutrients
% (e.g.\ phosphates), or removal of biomass (harvesting).

  \caption{Illustrations of stable fixed points in cubic differential
    equations. Fixed points $x_{-}$ and $x_{+}$ are shown as blue. The
    blue lines indicate the gradients at the fixed points. Extrema are
    shown in red. The intercept
    $\Delta dx_i / dt = c_i + C_i(\vectorsym{x}) + \agentimpact_i(t)$ is
    shown as a dark grey bar. Top: At $\Delta dx_i / dt = 0$,
    gradients at both fixed points are equal. Middle: At

    at $x_{+}$ increases.}
  \label{fig_cubicdemo}

\end{figure}

Each element in our system has one or two stable fixed points. For the
special case of
$c_i = 0, C_i(\vectorsym{x}) = 0, \agentimpact_i(t) = 0$, there are two
stable fixed points which can be straightforwardly found as
$x_{-} = -1$ and $x_{+} = 1$. The local extrema in this special case
can be found at $\pm \xextremum = \pm 1 / \sqrt{3}$, and the rate of
change at these extrema evaluates to
$\pm d\xextremum / dt = \pm \ccrit = \pm 2 / 3\sqrt{3} \approx \pm
0.38$.

In the general case, $c_i$, $C(\vectorsym{x})$ and $\agentimpact_i(t)$
take on arbitrary values, shifting the cubic function along the
$dx / dt$ axis while the extrema remain unchanged, and consequently,
the stable fixed points are constrained to $x_{-} < -\xextremum$ and
$x_{+} > \xextremum$ respectively. Element $i$ has two stable fixed
points if
$-\ccrit < c_i + C_i(\vectorsym{x}) + \agentimpact_i < \ccrit$, as
illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig_cubicdemo}. Elements also have an
unstable fixed point, which merges into a semi-stable fixed point in
the corner cases of
$c_i + C_i(\vectorsym{x}) + \agentimpact_i = \pm \ccrit$, but we will
subsequently focus on fully stable fixed points only.
Fig.~\ref{fig_cubicdemo} also shows that as the intercept
$c_i + C_i(\vectorsym{x}) + \agentimpact_i(t)$ increases, the gradient
of the cubic function gets flatter at $x_{-}$ and steeper at $x_{+}$.
This gradient can also be interpreted as the speed with which the
tipping element returns to the fixed point after a small perturbation.
A more negative gradient results in a higher speed, and is therefore
indicative of a higher level of stability.

Due to the DAG structure of interactions, the stable fixed points of
element $i$ only depend on the state of elements $1, \ldots, i - 1$.
This enables efficient computation of the stable fixed points of the
entire system.

If the intercept is constant, $C_i(\vectorsym{x}$ will converge as
elements $1, \ldots, i - 1$ converge towards their respective fixed
points, which will facilitate convergence of element $i$ as well.
Allowing cyclic interactions would result in the emergenc of
qualitatively different dynamics, such as cyclic attractors. As a
simple example, setting $d_{ij} = -d_{ji}$ and setting all other
parameters to $0$ gives rise to a cyclic attractor in which elements
$i$ and $j$ oscillate between negative and positive values.

From this perspective, restricting $(d_{ji})$ to a lower triangular
matrix of random values can be considered to define the most general
class of coupled cubic differential equations in which the elements
retain the property of having two stable fixed points that can
meaningfully be designated $x_{-}$ and $x_{+}$.


May has introduced a method for assessing stability of fixed points in
complex systems described in terms of differential equations
\cite{May1972_stablelargecomplexsystem}. This approach uses a Jacobian
$A = (a_{ji})$ which, for our system and a fixed point
$\vectorsym{x}_* = (x_{1*}, \ldots, x_{n*})^T$, evaluates to
\begin{equation}
  a_{ji} = \frac{d x_i}{d x_j d t} = \delta_{ji} (1 - 3 x_{i*}^2) + d_{ji}.
\end{equation}
May's approach uses the mean square value $\langle a_{ji} \rangle$ to
predict whether $\vectorsym{x}_*$ is a stable fixed point. We have
shown that all fixed points are stable in our system. Nonetheless, the
diagonal elements of $A$ are useful to characterise fixed points, as
they contain the gradient of \ref{eq_coupledwithagent} for each
element at a fixed point. The rest of the matrix is the same for all
fixed points. Therefore, we focus on the diagonal and noticing that
$d_{ii} = 0$ in our system, we define the sum of derivative squares
for a fixed point as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq_dss}
  \sum_i ((1 - 3 x_{i*}^2))^2.
\end{equation}



\subsection{Empowerment}


% \section{Combined Framework}

% We present now the core framework.
% An individual ``cubic tipping element'' as defined by
% Eq.~\ref{eq_cubic} has one or two stable fixed points. In the simple
% special case of $c = 0$, there are two stable fixed points which can
% be straightforwardly found as $x_{-} = -1$ and $x_{+} = 1$,
% \cite{Klose2019_interactingtippingelements} refer to these as the
% ``normal'' and the ``tipped'' state, respectively. The third, unstable
% fixed point at $x_{\mathrm{unstable}} = 0$ is not important for the
% work presented here.

% The condition for an individual tipping element to have two stable
% fixed points can thus be stated more precisely as
% $-\ccrit < c < \ccrit$. This condition generalises to
% $-\ccrit < c + C_i(\vectorsym{x}) + \agentimpact_i < \ccrit$ for a
% tipping element $i$ in a system of coupled elements subject to impacts
% by the agent.

To compute empowerment in the tipping scenario, we determine the
potential stable points that can be ``intentionally'' induced by the
agent. We discretise the state of the environment by distinguishing
only the two stable states $x_{i+}$ and $x_{i-}$ for each element $i$,
resulting in a state set $\stateset$ with $|\stateset| \le 2^n$. As in
our previous work \cite{Kim2009_sustainability}, we assume no noise in
the agent sensing and actuation. Empowerment is thus determined by the
number of states which the agent can reach by applying its actuators
$\agentimpact_i$.

We use stable fixed points of the unimpacted environment, i.e.\ with
$\agentimpact_i(t) = 0 \forall i, t$, as starting points for which we
characterise empowerment, and allow the agent to impact the
environment by choosing to set $\agentimpact_i$ to $-E$, $0$ or $E$,
where $E$ is a parameter setting the strength of the impact, or
control, of the agent on the environment.

If these controls were applied permanently and sufficiently large,
e.g. $E \gg \ccrit + \max_i C_i$, the agent could directly dial the
state of each component, and consequently its empowerment would take
the maximal value of $n$ bits. At the other extreme, setting $E = 0$
prevents the agent from having any impact on the environment and its
empowerment vanishes in all states.

A crucial concern in sustainability, and about tipping points
specifically, is that human impacts could result in changes to the
environment that are permanent, i.e.\ that stopping an impact may not
be sufficient to restore the environment to its ``normal'' state.
Therefore, we only want to count state changes that persist when the
direct control of the agent is removed. We implement this by letting
the agent apply its impact for a limited time only, which is followed
by a relaxation period during which the environment evolves on its own
and converges towards one of its fixed points. A state $s'$ found at
at the end of this relaxation period is defined to be $E$-accessible from
the initial state $s$. Formally, empowerment is given by
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq_empowerment}
  \empowerment(E, s) =
  \log_2(|\{s': s' \mbox{ is } E\mbox{-accessible from } s\}|)
\end{equation}

In previous work, e.g.\ \cite{Salge2014_empowermentintro} the agent's
reach is typically restricted by a time horizon for its actions. Here,
instead, we will explore empowerment as a function of limits on
$\agentimpact_i$, i.e.\ the strength of effect that the agent can
exert on tipping elements $i \in \{1, \ldots, n\}$. It is important to
notice that an increasing range of $\agentimpact_i$, analogously to an
increasing time horizon, results in increasing empowerment.

Empowerment as measured by \ref{eq_empowerment} increases as the
number of accessible states grows. However, in some states, the agent
may be unable to meet some of its needs. If the agent brings the
environment into such a state permanently and irretrievably, that
would compromise the agent's ability to meet its needs in the future.
This would make an actuation (i.e.\ a way of using or interacting with
the environment) unsustainable in the sense of the Brundtland
commission. However, if the agent is capable of returning the
environment into its initial state, the ability to meet its future
needs would not be compromised. This provides us with a criterion to
distinguish between sustainable and (potentially) unsustainable
actuations which does not require any external (and possibly arbitrary
or contentious) designation of states as sustainable or unsustainable.
Therefore, consistently with our previous work we define a state $s'$
to be reversibly accessible from a state $s$ if $s'$ is accessible
from $s$ and $s$ is accessible from $s'$. This allows us to apply our
previous definition of sustainable empowerment as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq_empowerment}
  \begin{aligned}
    & \sustainableempowerment(E, s) = \\
    & \log_2(|\{s': s' \mbox{ is
      reversibly } E\mbox{-accessible from } s\}|).
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Fig.~\ref{fig_dssempcorr} shows the Pearson correlation coefficients

The pattern of negative correlations at small values of $E$ and
positive correlations at larger values is corroberated. For
sustainable empowerment, positive correlations at larger values of $E$
are also found, while a negative correlation at small $E$ is largely
missing.



\section{Discussion and Outlook}

\textbf{to be updated and extended to discuss stability / correlation
  to sum of derivative squares}

% This deficiency has long been an impediment to public discourse
% \cite{Kim2001_plantbiodiversity}.

We have introduced systems comprised of coupled tipping elements
affected by an agent as a model to study sustainability and to
quantify it using the principled concept of empowerment
\cite{Salge2014_empowermentintro}, rooted in information theory
\cite{CoverThomas1991_informationtheory}. The cubic differential
equation systems, which we use here, capture essential aspects of
sustainability have been applied in sustainability research and
beyond, as reviewed e.g.\ by
\cite{Klose2019_interactingtippingelements}. By including an agent,
our system opens up opportunities to model sustainability as a
property that emerges as an agent interacts with a system. This allows
for a more precise characterisation and formalisation of
sustainability, separating it from more general systems stability,
such as ecosystem stability.

Our plans to further develop this approach include studying the
effects of providing the agent with different actuation channels. An
alternative to allowing the agent to impact all elements equally is to
restrict the agent to impact only one system directly. In this
scenario, high levels of empowerment result if the agent is able to
affect a large number of elements indirectly via their coupling. We
therefore anticipate that stronger coupling will increase, rather than
decrease, empowerment. It will be interesting to investigate whether
susceptibility to ``domino effects'' between elements can be
characterised in this way, and specifically systems in which an
element can cause a downstream element to tip, as described by
\cite{Brummitt2015_coupledcatastrophes}.

Empowerment in its general form considers an agent to receive signals
from the environment, and to send signals to the environment through
its actuators. Both sensors and actuators can be affected by noise. As
humankind, we have only partial and noisy data from our environment,
and our control over our action at a population or society level is
imperfect as well. Therefore, it is important to understand the impact
of these imperfections on sustainability.


% TODO discuss asymmetry
% Shifting the offset c in a tipping unit permits producing a
% hysteresis which makes it easier (for the agent) to "tip" the system
% into the other stable state, while the reverse operation becomes
% more difficult.

It is interesting to note that the offset $c$ produces a hysteresis
which makes it easier(for the agent to tip the system in one direction
(from $x_{-}$ to $x_{+}$ if $c > 0$) while the reverse operation
becomes more difficult. This enables applying the concept of
sustainable empowerment, which we introduced in
\cite{Kim2009_sustainability}, to systems of coupled tipping elements
as well.

Finally, a strength of our model is that it allows efficient
computation of fixed point as well as integrating differential
equations to produce time series. This opens perspectives to
investigate the potential of investigating the use of time series for
characterising and quantifying sustainability, e.g.\ as a tool to
identify risks of breakdowns in sustainability or to identify elements
that are especially relevant to maintaining sustainability.




% From perspective for the work presented here include 

%  as minimalistic ALife systems
% to model essential aspects of sustainability in the context of an
% agent trying to maintain and manipulate an ecosystem. We have shown
% the essential properties \ref{hinz und kunz}, and demonstrated that
% this \ref{hurzt und schnurzt}, showing that the system can serve as a
% proof-of-concept framework to study the effect of reversible,
% sustainable management by an agent vs.\ its opposite.

%% However, they provide no inherent way of distinguishing between
%% sustainability and stability. In this paper we use them as a model of
%% an environment which interacts with an agent. This allows us to
%% characterise states that can be reached (and stabilised) by the
%% agent's actuators as candidates for sustainable states.

% perspectives on introducing noise?
% discuss interpretative scenarios, e.g. some "actuation" may benefit
% the agent and add to its ability whereas others may be "cost" --
% e.g. emitting more carbon may allow more Haber-Bosch nitrogen
% fixation...? but adding carbon capture may diminish / be a cost...?

\subsection{Results (Old)}

We generated the variable parameters $c_i$ and the lower triangle of
$(d_{ji})$ by drawing from uniform distributions. The values of $c_i$
were drawn from $[-0.1, 1]$, and we created an environment with weaker
coupling constants $d_{ji} \in [-0.2, 0.2]$ and one with stronger
coupling constants $d_{ji} \in [-0.8, 2=0.8]$.

Fig.~\ref{fig_empowermentprofiles} shows profiles of empowerment as a
function of $E$, the agent's potential impact on the environment's
tipping elements. At $E = 0$, empowerment is $0$ as the agent is
unable to make any change to the stable state of the environment.
Fig~\ref{fig_empowermentprofiles} shows results for the ``normal''
stable state in which most elements are at $x_{i-}$. Given to the
symmetric method of generating our system's parameters, this
``normal'' is representative for the states of the system in general.

At $E = 0$ the agent has no empowerment, as explained above, and this
extends into small nonzero values of $E$. This is because for an
element in the ``normal'' stable state $x_{i-}$, it is necessary that
$E > \ccrit + C_i$ for the agent to put the element into the
``tipped'' state $x_{i+}$. This explains the emergence of nonzero
empowerment around $E = \ccrit$. Such shifts are somewhat easier with
weaker coupling, which is reflected by the onset of empowerment at
slightly lower $E$.

It is also noticeable from Fig.~\ref{fig_empowermentprofiles} that
weaker coupling enables the agent to attain higher empowerment. One
reason for this is that the number of stable states is maximal in
systems with no coupling at all. In this special case, each element
can be set to each of its two states, independently of all other
elements. At the other end of the scale, a strong interaction from an
upstream element $j$, say with $d_{ji} x_j > \ccrit$, increases the
chance that element $i$ has only one stable state altogether. As a
result, the number of stable system states decreases as the range of
randomly generated $d_{ji}$ increases, explaining also the lower
plateau in empowerment seen with strong coupling.


\subsection{Additional Introductory Notes}

Cubic differential equations are a simple (arguably the simplest)
systems for studying tipping processes. There always is at least one
stable fixed point, i.e.\ one root of the differential equation where
the first derivative is negative, and if the effective intercept is
within a suitable range, two stable fixed points exist, thus enabling
the system to be in two alternative states.

Sustainability has been characterised based on ecosystems properties,
such as existence of fixed points or robustness to perturbations.
While it is clear (or at least entirely plausible) that some form of
stability or robustness is a necessary condition for sustainability,
this condition is not likely sufficient. System states that are very
stable but would not be considered sustainable are easy to construct.
As an example, increasing the average temperature on earth by more
than 5 degrees might well be considered unsustainable even if it could
be shown that the state of the earth's climate system would be very
stable after that amount of global warming. Typical sustainability
concerns put forward in such a scenario include loss of arable land
caused by e.g.\ rising sea levels and desertification. This reveals
that sustainability includes an aspect of providing ``ecosystem
services'' or generating ``natural capital''.

In the past we have introduced the approach of expressly including the
entity, or the agent, which is to be sustained, in a model
\cite{Kim2009_sustainability}. Here, we demonstrate application of
this approach to systems of coupled tipping elements, which have been
established as a simple formalisation of systems for investigating
aspects of stability and sustainability.


\subsection{Additional Discussion Items}

The stability of systems of coupled differential equations has been an
area of interest since decades
\cite{May1972_stablelargecomplexsystem,Landi2018_ecologicalnetworks}.

\cite{May1972_stablelargecomplexsystem} considers a very general
class of dynamic systems, characterised locally by a Jacobian. In this
context, stability is defined by fixed points, whereas other
attractors (cyclic or strange) are considered to represent
instability.

We deliberately restrict coupling to a directed acyclic graph. As a
result, all attractors are fixed points, so in the sense of
\cite{May1972_stablelargecomplexsystem} these systems are always
``stable''.

If elements governed by cubic differential equations are allowed to
mutually impact each other (i.e.\ element $i$ impacts on element $j$
and vice versa), it is rather easy to construct systems in which the
elements do not have any fixed points, but are jointly participating
in a cyclic attractor. As a result, these elements can no longer be
characterised as being in one of two discretisable states
(characterised by fixed points labelled ``sustainable'' and
``tipped'', respectively. From this perspective, coupling of cubic
differential equations with a DAG, as used in this paper, can be
considered to be the most general way of coupling that preserves the
``tipping element'' characteristic of the individual elements.
